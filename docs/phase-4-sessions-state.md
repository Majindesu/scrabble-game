## Technical Architecture

### Session State Structure
```typescript
interface GameSession {
  id: string
  gameId: string
  players: SessionPlayer[]
  spectators: string[]
  status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'reconnecting' | 'finished'
  pausedAt?: Date
  pauseReason?: string
  settings: SessionSettings
  snapshots: GameStateSnapshot[]
}
```

### Player Profile Schema
```typescript
interface PlayerProfile {
  id: string
  username: string
  avatar?: string
  bio?: string
  stats: PlayerStats
  preferences: GamePreferences
  createdAt: Date
  lastSeen: Date
}
```

### Chat Message Schema
```typescript
interface ChatMessage {
  id: string
  gameId: string
  playerId: string
  message: string
  type: 'game' | 'spectator' | 'system'
  timestamp: Date
  reactions?: Reaction[]
}
```

## User Flows

### Reconnecting to Game
1. Player loses connection during game
2. Game is automatically paused
3. Player reopens app/refreshes page
4. System detects reconnection attempt
5. Game state is synchronized
6. Game resumes automatically

### Spectating a Game
1. Find ongoing game to spectate
2. Join as spectator
3. View real-time game progress
4. Chat with other spectators
5. See detailed game information
6. Leave spectator mode anytime

### Tournament Play
1. Browse available tournaments
2. Register for tournament
3. Get bracket assignment
4. Play tournament games in sequence
5. Track progress through bracket
6. View final tournament results

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk**: Session state becomes too large for efficient storage
  - **Mitigation**: Implement state compression, periodic cleanup

- **Risk**: Reconnection logic becomes complex and error-prone
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, fallback mechanisms

- **Risk**: Chat system becomes spam vector
  - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, moderation tools, report system

- **Risk**: Social features add significant database load
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize queries, implement caching, pagination

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for database
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize WebSocket message serialization
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for chat and API calls
- [ ] Add database indexing for social queries

## Notes for Next Phase
- Session management patterns established here will be crucial for production
- Social features provide foundation for community building
- Tournament system can be expanded significantly in later phases
