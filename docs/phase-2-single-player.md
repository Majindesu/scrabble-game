## User Flows

### Starting a Game
1. Navigate to new game page
2. Game initializes with shuffled tiles
3. Player gets 7 tiles in rack
4. Board shows empty 15x15 grid

### Making a Move
1. Drag tiles from rack to board
2. See real-time score preview
3. Click submit move button
4. Move validated and score applied
5. New tiles drawn from bag

### Handling Invalid Moves
1. Player places invalid word
2. System shows specific error message
3. Tiles return to rack
4. Player can try again

### Ending a Game
1. Game ends when conditions met

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk**: Drag and drop performance issues on mobile
  - **Mitigation**: Implement touch-specific optimizations, test on various devices

- **Risk**: Complex word validation slows gameplay
  - **Mitigation**: Implement caching, optimize dictionary queries

- **Risk**: Premium square logic becomes complex
  - **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive test cases, clear documentation

## Notes for Next Phase
- Single player experience should be polished before multiplayer
- Consider AI opponent as bridge to multiplayer (optional)
- Game state management patterns established here will be crucial for multiplayer
