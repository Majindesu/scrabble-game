- **Risk**: Mobile performance suffers with animations
  - **Mitigation**: Implement performance monitoring, optimize animations

- **Risk**: Achievement system becomes too gamified
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on meaningful achievements that encourage good play

- **Risk**: PWA features don't work consistently
  - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, fallbacks for unsupported features

## Notes for Next Phase
