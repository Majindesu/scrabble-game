## Acceptance Criteria

### WebSocket Functionality
- [ ] Multiple players can connect simultaneously
- [ ] Real-time message delivery (<100ms latency)
- [ ] Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- [ ] Graceful handling of connection errors
- [ ] Authentication works for WebSocket connections

### Room Management
- [ ] Players can create and join rooms
- [ ] Room capacity limits enforced (2-4 players)
- [ ] Room state persists across disconnections
- [ ] Players can leave rooms cleanly
- [ ] Spectators can observe games

### Game Synchronization
- [ ] All players see identical game state
- [ ] Moves are synchronized in real-time
- [ ] Turn order is enforced
- [ ] Score updates appear for all players
- [ ] Invalid moves are rejected consistently

### User Experience
- [ ] Smooth real-time updates without flickering
- [ ] Clear indication of other players' actions
- [ ] Connection status is always visible
- [ ] Loading states for room operations
- [ ] Error messages for connection issues

### Performance
- [ ] Supports 4 concurrent players per room
- [ ] Multiple rooms can run simultaneously
- [ ] No memory leaks in long-running games
- [ ] Efficient message broadcasting
- [ ] Database queries optimized for multiplayer

## Technical Architecture

### WebSocket Message Types
```typescript
type WSMessage = 
  | { type: 'game_state', data: GameState }
  | { type: 'player_move', data: Move }
  | { type: 'turn_change', data: { playerId: string } }
  | { type: 'player_joined', data: Player }
  | { type: 'player_left', data: { playerId: string } }
  | { type: 'error', data: { message: string } }
```

### Room State Structure
```typescript
interface Room {
  id: string
  players: Player[]
  gameState: GameState
  settings: RoomSettings
  status: 'waiting' | 'active' | 'finished'
  createdAt: Date
  maxPlayers: number
}
```

### Database Schema Updates
- Add `room_id` to games table
- Create rooms table for persistence
- Add player session management
- WebSocket connection tracking

## User Flows

### Joining a Multiplayer Game
1. Navigate to multiplayer lobby
2. Browse available rooms or quick match
3. Join room and wait in lobby
4. Game starts when enough players ready
5. Play synchronized multiplayer game

### Creating a Room
1. Click "Create Room" button
2. Configure room settings (players, time limits)
3. Share room code with friends (optional)
4. Wait for players to join
5. Start game when ready

### During Multiplayer Game
1. See all players' scores and status
2. Wait for turn in proper order
3. Make moves with real-time updates
4. See opponents' moves immediately
5. Chat with other players (basic)

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk**: WebSocket scalability issues
  - **Mitigation**: Implement connection pooling, consider Redis for scaling

- **Risk**: State synchronization conflicts
  - **Mitigation**: Implement optimistic locking, rollback mechanisms

- **Risk**: Network latency affects gameplay
  - **Mitigation**: Add turn timers, optimize message size, show loading states

- **Risk**: Player disconnections disrupt games
  - **Mitigation**: Implement pause/resume, AI takeover for disconnected players

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] WebSocket connection testing
- [ ] Multiplayer game simulation
- [ ] Stress testing with multiple concurrent rooms
- [ ] Network disconnect/reconnect scenarios
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Notes for Next Phase
- This phase establishes the real-time multiplayer foundation
- Phase 4 will build on this with advanced session management
- Consider load testing before moving to production features
